What happens when a class statements top level contains a basic assignment statement?\nA =when class statement's top level contains assignment statement it is considered as class attribute or class level attribute\nwhere as assignment statement traeted as instances or local attribute\nwhen instance is created single copy of attribute is created and shareed to all instances of class\"\"\"\nclass human:\n    spieces : \"homosepiens\"\n    def __init__(self,name,age):\n        self.name=name\n        self.age=age","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass's __init__ method?\nA =IF child class has __init__ method then it will not inherite from super class , in simple words init method of child class overrides init method of super class\nso we have to manually call cuper class by super__init__()\n\"\"\"\nclass emp:\n    def __init__(self,name,age):\n        self.name=name\n        self.age=age\nclass subordinate(emp):\n    def __init__(self,name,age,salary):\n        super().__init__(name,age):\n            self.salary=salary\nemp1=emp(\"rahul\",28,30000)\nprint(emp1__dict__)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"4.

How is the local scope of a class different from that of a function?\nA =a variable inside a function is not accessible outside function range from starting def to exit of function\n\nsimilarly a variable inside of a class is limited to class scope\"\"\"\ndef hello(name):\n    name = name\n    print(f'you\\'re name is {name}')\nhello('Mano Vishnu')\ntry:\n    name\nexcept NameError:\n    print('Name varible is not available outside hello function scope')\n\nclass Person:\n    species = \"HomeSapines\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\nprint(Person.species) # Accessing species using class name\nMale = Person()\nprint(Male.species) # Accessing species using instance of class","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.13","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
