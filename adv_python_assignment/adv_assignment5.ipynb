What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\nA = inheritance is noting but using code of parent class by child class when child inherits properties from multiple \nparent class is called multiple inheritance\n\"\"\"\nclass parent:\n    pass\nclass guardian:\n    pass\nclass child(parent,guardian):\n    pass\n","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"Q2.

What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\nA = Pseudoprivate attributes are also useful in larger frameworks or tools, both to avoid introducing new method names that might accidentally hide definitions elsewhere in the class tree and to reduce the chance of internal methods being replaced by names defined lower in the tree. If a method is intended for use only within a class that may be mixed into other classes, the double underscore prefix ensures that the method won't interfere with other names in the tree, especially in multiple-inheritance scenarios\n\nPseudoprivate names also prevent subclasses from accidentally redefining the internal method's names,\"\"\"\nclass Super:\n    def method(self): # A real application method\n        pass\nclass Tool:\n    def _method(self): # becomes _Tool_method\n        pass\n    def other(self): # uses internal method\n        self._method()\nclass Subl(Tool,Super):\n    def actions(self):\n        self.method()\nclass Sub2(Tool):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.method = 99","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.15","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
