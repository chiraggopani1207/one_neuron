Make a comparison and\ncontrast between the two.\na =List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map.\nList comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility. For example, to print all odd numbers in range of 50, we can write [n for n in range(50) if n%2 != 0]. There is no alternate for it in map\nList comprehension are used when a list of results is required as final output.but map only returns a map object. it needs to be explicitly coverted to desired datatype.\nList comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express\nMap is faster in case of calling an already defined function on a set of values.\"\"\"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.13","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
